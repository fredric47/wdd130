        <p>Hi, my name is Luke Pratt, I live in Utah, U.S.A. I have lived here all my life and I have enjoyed it. I like learning about software and web development as well as working in my dad's machine shop. I like making new things and seeing things that I did work like they should. One of my hobbies is making and flying radio controled model airplanes with my brothers, it is a lot of fun even when a plane gets crashed accidentally. I was born to my parents at a very young age and have been living life since. I am one of several childeren living in a great family.</p>
